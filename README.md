## Decision Trees
Decision Trees are a type of Supervised Machine Learning where the data is continuously split according to a certain parameter.

## Discriminative Lineae Models (DLMs)
A Discriminative Linear Model (DLM) is a type of model used in machine learning for classification or regression tasks. It is a class of logistical models that distinguish decision boundaries through observed data.

## Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)
Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) are a flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression that allows for response variables with error distribution models other than a normal distribution.

## Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are supervised learning methods used for classification, regression, and outliers detection.

## Neural Networks
Neural Networks are a class of machine learning models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes organized in layers, with each node performing a simple computation. Neural networks have gained popularity due to their ability to learn complex patterns from data.

### Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is a feedforward artificial neural network model that consists of multiple layers of nodes, each connected to the next in a feedforward manner. MLPs are capable of learning nonlinear relationships in data and are widely used for various tasks such as classification and regression.
