## Decision Trees
Decision Trees are a type of Supervised Machine Learning where the data is continuously split according to a certain parameter.

## Discriminative Lineae Models (DLMs)
A Discriminative Linear Model (DLM) is a type of model used in machine learning for classification or regression tasks. It is a class of logistical models that distinguish decision boundaries through observed data.

## Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)
Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) are a flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression that allows for response variables with error distribution models other than a normal distribution.

## Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are supervised learning methods used for classification, regression, and outliers detection.
