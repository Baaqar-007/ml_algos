Sure, let's break down the code:

1. `import numpy as np`: This line imports the numpy library and assigns it the alias `np`. Numpy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in the domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.

2. `def sigmoid(x): return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))`: This defines a function called `sigmoid` that takes an input `x` and returns the sigmoid of `x`. The sigmoid function maps any value to a value between 0 and 1 and is often used in machine learning for binary classification problems.

3. `def newtons_method(X, y, num_iters=10):`: This defines a function called `newtons_method` that takes inputs `X`, `y`, and an optional parameter `num_iters` which defaults to 10 if not provided. This function will implement Newton's method for optimization.

4. `m, n = X.shape`: This line gets the shape of the array `X` and assigns it to `m` and `n`. Here, `m` is the number of training examples and `n` is the number of features.

5. `theta = np.zeros(n)`: This initializes a vector `theta` of size `n` with all zeros. This vector represents the parameters of our model.

6. `for _ in range(num_iters):`: This starts a loop that will run for a number of times equal to `num_iters`.

7. `h = sigmoid(X @ theta)`: This calculates the hypothesis function for all training examples using the current parameters in `theta`.

8. `gradient = X.T @ (h - y)`: This calculates the gradient of the cost function.

9. `hessian = X.T @ np.diag(h * (1 - h)) @ X`: This calculates the Hessian matrix, which is used in Newton's method to find the direction of steepest descent.

10. `theta -= np.linalg.inv(hessian) @ gradient`: This updates our parameters theta by subtracting the product of the inverse of the Hessian matrix and the gradient from it.

11. `return theta`: After all iterations are complete, this returns our final parameters stored in theta.

This code implements Newton's method for logistic regression, which is a binary classification algorithm.
